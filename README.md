# About project
This project covers different topics related to Android development. Firstly, it is focused on creating custom components that handle displaying and manipulating images on the screen, indicating their relative positions, and resizing. The identical functionality is implemented using two approaches: Imperative (View) and Declarative (Compose).

# Plan:
1. ✅ Create an empty Android project
2. ✅ Create two screens which will hold different approaches: View and Composable
3. ✅ Create two elements which will hold the main logic: View and Composable
4. ✅ Create two stub assets to accelerate the development process. The rest of the logic will be implemented later.
5. ✅ Start developing custom view
6. ✅ Add logic to add a new element to the view
7. ✅ Add logic to select and deselect an element by tapping
8. ✅ Add logic for moving an element
9. ⬜ Add logic for moving an element without crossing the border (optional)
10. ✅ Add logic to display lines when the element reaches the center position of the view
11. ✅ Check the correct functionality of the implemented features for several items on the screen
12. ✅ Add logic to display lines relative to other items
13. ⬜ Add logic for theming (optional)
14. ⬜ Set up correct display previews (optional)
15. ✅ Add logic to display a bottom view for the selection overlay
16. ✅ Add logic to fetch overlays from remote sources to display on the bottom sheet
17. ✅ Add logic to load items for local use on the device
18. ✅ Start developing Composable. Repeat steps from 6 to 14
19. ⬜ Write tests to cover the implemented functionality
20. ⬜ Add logic for resizing elements for both solutions
21. ⬜ Add logic for rotating elements for both solutions
22. ⬜ Development improvements (logging, static analysis, extracting into a separate module, documentation) (optional)
23. ⬜ Add logic to generate the final image after manipulation (optional)
